# SAE-Project2

Project 2 for Software Architecture &amp; Engineering

Because everyone loves java and having to work in a VM with 10 fps (using a mac) <3


# To Do

- (Handle multiple robots) (almost done)
- Test_Loops and Test_WhileAndBreak yield unsatisfying results, seem very imprecise (at least it's sound)
- Write unit tests
