# SAE-Project2

Project 2 for Software Architecture &amp; Engineering

Because everyone loves java and having to work in a VM with 10 fps (using a mac) <3


# To Do

- Fix argument overlap detection, use expression of Polka instead of intervals (way too imprecise, see Test_ArgOverlap)
- Fix crash for certain programs as inputs (see Test_CrashJRE)
- Fix issue with equality in while statement (see Test_WhileAndBreak)
- (Handle multiple robots (almost done))
