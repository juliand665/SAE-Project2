# SAE-Project2

Project 2 for Software Architecture &amp; Engineering

Because everyone loves java and having to work in a VM with 10 fps (using a mac) <3


# To Do

- Improve argument overlap detection, if possible
- Use more abstract methods of PAG rather than the recursive stuff we're using right now for getCurrentConstraints
- Fix issue with equality in while statement (see Test_WhileAndBreak) (not sure if this is still a problem)
